# Milestones Chapter 1: Catching up on 2013

In 2013, WordPress was ten years old, and a far cry from the small personal project it had been at the beginning of 2003. 

At this point, more than half of all websites using a content management system were using WordPress. That came to 69 million websites, or 19% of all the websites online. One hundred thousand new WordPress websites were being created every day, and 500,000 daily new posts were published. 

WordPress site users could choose from 26,252 plugins. 80 new themes were approved every month. 

The WordPress [official tally](https://wordpress.com/blog/2014/01/06/2013-review/) for 2013 was impressive. By the end of the year, there were 13,704,819 new WordPress blogs created in 2013 alone. 489,281,136 new posts had been published. 667,675,929 comments had been posted — an average of 21 comments in each second of 2013. Posts had received 95,424,985 Likes. 

The goal of WordPress was then as it is today, the democratization of publishing. 10 years into the project, building a website and publishing it online, thanks to the WordPress platform, was easier than ever before. People were able to connect with  other enthusiasts of any interest, however small the group of enthusiasts might be. Everyone could find their clique anywhere in the world. The world had never experienced this degree of connection, digital or otherwise, before.

WordPress was no longer just a blogging platform. It was the content management system that empowered users and let them make sure that their websites were more than a pretty face. For the first time, an individual with a dream could create an online presence with the same kind of presence and heft as a major company. A small nonprofit could show their commitment to their cause and bring in volunteers and donations just like a well-established organization. From fantasy sports leagues to town history archives, every project could find its home on the web.

Matt reported in his [State of the Word address for 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OczuAfRZyc) that 69% of respondents said they were using WordPress as a content management system, not as a blogging platform. 

It was not by any means the only web building platform or content management system available, but WordPress stood out among its competitors. The famous five-minute install meant that everyone could – if they were willing to put in the effort to learn – build their own website. The system of themes and plugins allowed site owners to create a look and functionality that would have required many hours of professional design and development just a few years before. 

And the supportive WordPress community allowed people to share their strengths and benefit from others’ strengths, to a degree not seen in other platforms. An open source solution drew involvement and encouraged innovation. A welcoming community brought people to solve challenges and to figure out ways to accomplish their goals. 

In fact, the annual WordPress survey in 2013 brought more than 30,000 responses from 178 countries, and there were two top favorite characteristics about WordPress: its ease of use, and the community. 

The impressive statistics about WordPress were just a reflection of the power of the software and its community.
